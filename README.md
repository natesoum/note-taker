  ## Description

  I was motivated to learn how to use express.js! It's a new take on how to approach fetch request and page traversal. It's very interesting and can be a better way of doing so, if you enjoy this approach. 

  I built this project to practice not only express.js but also practice modular routing and practice keeping my files organized while being able to access the data of all the files as well. 

  This project helps user keep their notes organized!

  I learned a ton! This wasn't one of the biggest project but learning how to work with node, express will help me a ton in the long run!

  ## Usage

  Type your note title & description then save it once you are done!
